# Alris - AI-Driven Yield Optimizer and Auto-Trader

Alris is an AI-powered platform designed to dynamically optimize yield and automate trading strategies on the Solana blockchain. Built with cutting-edge technologies, Alris utilizes real-time market data and integrates with Solana's infrastructure to execute informed data-driven transactions. This project is currently in its MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage.

## MVP Demo

You can watch the demo video here: [Loom Video Link](https://www.loom.com/share/82924a7413714214b7bfd4b6f978fbe2?sid=ac8688d2-3c7c-48e0-9b87-8e14183c9659)

**Note:** The MVP is not deployed due to unresolved dependency bugs.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Yield Optimization**
   - Fetches real-time data from CoinGecko and Orca API.
   - Leverages Solana Agent Kit for transaction execution and updates.

2. **AI-Driven Strategy**
   - Process market data through GPTv4 to determine optimal trading and yield strategies.
   
3. **Automated Transactions**
   - Transfers funds and tracks updates directly through the Solana blockchain.

4. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Continuously monitors market conditions and adjusts strategies accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for building the front end of the application.
- **Solana Agent Kit**: This is for fetching wallet data and executing on-chain transactions.
- **Switchboard Oracle**: Used to pull accurate and real-time data feeds.
- **CoinGecko API**: Fetches price data for top trading tokens.
- **Orca API**: Retrieves yield-generating pools.
- **Grok XAI**: Processes data and generates strategies using explainable AI.
